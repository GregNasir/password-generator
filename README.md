# password-generator

This project entailed adding code to a password generator webpage, to create random passwords. Users will be able choose specific parameters, and in return, presented with results that match their selections. Steps taken in this process were:

* Javascript codes added to produce results
* Semantic HTML attributes added to source code
* Added comments to HTML, CSS,  and Javascript files
* Deployed webpage
* Made several commits to GitHub

Adding Javascript codes to this project gave me a real indepth insight on the usage if statements, functions, and for loops and booleans.
